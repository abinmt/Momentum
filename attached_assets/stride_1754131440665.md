Create a habit tracker called “stride” . This should be an exact Progressive Web App (PWA) clone of https://streaksapp.com/. The goal is to replicate its design, core features, and user experience as closely as possible, ensuring it functions as a modern, installable PWA. Please refer to the attached screen shots for the visual replication.

\*\*Design Specifications:\*\*  
Meticulously replicate the UI/UX, color schemes, typography, spacing, layout, and overall aesthetic of https://streaksapp.com/. Pay close attention to subtle animations, transitions, and interactive elements to provide a smooth, app-like feel. Ensure the design is fully responsive and optimized for all devices: mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. Implement a highly customizable interface, including the ability to switch between 78 different color themes and select from over 600 task icons, mirroring the original app's personalization options.

\*\*Core Features \*\*  
1\.  \*\*Habit/Task Management:\*\* Implement robust creation and management of positive habits and "negative tasks." Include flexible scheduling options: daily, specific days of the week (e.g., Monday-Friday), or a set number of times per week (e.g., 3 days/week).  
2\.  \*\*Tracking & Progress:\*\* Develop comprehensive streak tracking, displaying current and best streaks, along with other relevant statistics. Allow users to record daily notes for tasks and set up "timed tasks."  
3\.  \*\*User Accounts & Data Sync:\*\* Implement a secure user authentication system and a backend database for storing all user-specific data (tasks, progress, settings) to enable seamless cross-device synchronization.  
4\.  \*\*Reminders & Notifications:\*\* Implement automatic task reminders via push notifications.  
5\.  \*\*Social/Sharing:\*\* Include functionality for users to share their tasks with others for encouragement and accountability.  
6\.  \*\*Health Integration (PWA Equivalent):\*\* Address the original app's iOS Health app integration. Explore the closest possible web-based equivalents using available Web APIs (e.g., Web Health API if applicable, or generic fitness APIs) or, if direct API access is not feasible for PWAs, implement a robust manual input system for health-related metrics (e.g., steps, heart rate, blood pressure). Clearly state the inherent limitations of replicating proprietary native integrations exactly within a PWA context.

\*\*PWA Specific Requirements:\*\*  
1\.  \*\*Installability:\*\* Ensure the application is fully installable across all major platforms: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Chrome OS.  
2\.  \*\*Web App Manifest:\*\* Generate and configure a comprehensive \`manifest.json\` file with appropriate app name, short name, icons (including maskable icons), start URL, display mode (standalone), theme color, and background color. \*Crucially, leverage Progressier's integration with Replit for automated manifest and service worker generation.\*  
3\.  \*\*Service Worker:\*\* Implement a robust service worker for:  
    \*   \*\*Offline Capabilities:\*\* Cache all essential app resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts) for complete offline access and provide fallback content.  
    \*   \*\*Offline Data Storage:\*\* Implement client-side data storage (e.g., IndexedDB) for user habits and progress, allowing users to interact with the app and make updates even when offline.  
    \*   \*\*Background Sync:\*\* Configure background synchronization through the service worker to ensure that offline data updates and pending actions are automatically synced with the backend when network connectivity is restored.  
    \*   \*\*Push Notifications:\*\* Enable full push notification functionality through the service worker for task reminders.  
4\.  \*\*Responsiveness:\*\* Ensure a fully responsive design that dynamically adapts to all screen sizes and orientations, maintaining usability and aesthetic integrity.  
5\.  \*\*Performance:\*\* Optimize the application for fast loading times and smooth, responsive interactions to ensure a high-quality user experience.  
6\.  \*\*HTTPS:\*\* Ensure the application is served entirely over HTTPS for security and service worker registration. (Note: Replit deployments handle SSL automatically).  
7\.  \*\*Deep Linking:\*\* Implement unique, shareable URLs for different sections or individual tasks within the app to enhance navigation and discoverability.

\*\*Technical Stack & Frameworks:\*\*  
For the frontend, use a modern JavaScript framework like Next.js. For the backend, use TypeScript framework NestJS and utilize Replit's built-in Database or integrate a lightweight NoSQL/SQL database for persistent user data and synchronization.
